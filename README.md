### Hello everyone 👋
My name is Leandro Filipe Lourenço Carvalho and I am a portuguese IMS (Informatikmittelschule) student currently living in Switzerland.

- 🔭 I'm currently working on a simple todo web-application which is being developed with Python (Django), which is also going to have a mobile version developed with React-Native
- 🌱 I am currently learning how to use the Python framework Django while working on the todo-application.
