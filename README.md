### Hello everyone ðŸ‘‹
My name is Leandro Filipe LourenÃ§o Carvalho and I'm currently in my first year of the bachelor in Software Engineering at the Universidade do Minho, in Braga, Portugal. I was born in Switzerland and that's where I've lived till 2024. I attended school in Switzerland, where I also visited the Informatikmittelschule (secondary-school which leads to a professional certificate as a Software Developer). In my last year in Switzerland I had the pleasure to do an internship at the ZÃ¼rcher Kantonalbank, where I helped to develop and maintain a high-availability application with Java (Spring Boot) and Angular). In 2024 I fullfilled my dream of going to college in the sunny Portugal, and that's where I'am at the moment.

- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on a Personal-Portfolio with Angular
